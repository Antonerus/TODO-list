# TODO-list
A simple webapp that creates a TODO-list for a user to add and remove tasks as they wish to it. Python is used to build the backend,
While HTML, Jinja and CSS was used to build the frontend. Flask is used to connect the backend to the frontend. SQL is used to create
a database that the app stores data on each TODO-list task as well as retrieve and modify.
